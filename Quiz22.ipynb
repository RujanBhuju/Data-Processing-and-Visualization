        "1)\tThe graph shows the influence of various agents on the FL3 and T24t metastatic cancer cell lines. The graphs are very simple as the position of the bars tells us the chloroquine treatment and the height of the bar indicates the % cell death and % of cell survival. The graphs are visually appealing, and the best part is that the graphs are color-coded. Just by looking at the color, we can identify the kind of cells that are being treated. The graphs are either skewed to the right or the left. Everything on the graph is properly labeled. One of the weaknesses would be that the graph is communicating less. Even after having 8 graphs, it is only indicating % cell death or survival.  Even if itâ€™s not the most efficient way to represent the data I think it is displaying excellence."

The line graph is simple as the position of the point shows the month and the total count of the sample. The graph is visually attractive. It clearly illustrates the result it is trying to convey. Even if the results are very clear but the amount of information it is showing is less.  The second graph is color-coded. Since it has different lines of organism it is very easier to compare among the organism in any given month. the graph surely illustrates excellence."
